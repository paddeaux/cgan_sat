# Conditional GAN for Synthetic Seasonal Satellite Imagery (Met Ã‰ireann Placement 2023)

This repo attempts to take evanhu1's conditional GAN implementation (https://github.com/evanhu1/pytorch-CelebA-faCeGAN) and apply it to the SEN12MS satellite imagery dataset. The aim is to produce a cGAN capable of producing synthetic satellite images from a given season, i.e. spring, summer, fall, winter. This work was not fully completed due to issues stemming from training with the SEN12 data.

## Setup
Requires CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to be be downloaded and placed in the main directory as a folder named .../celeba/.

## Model Architecture

Generator                  |  Discriminator

## Discussion
I have implemented a dataloader which correctly loads the SEN12MS images along with appropriate seasonal labels to the network, with the hopes of training the model as described above. In testing it was found that issues arose when reducing the number of attributes from the original 40 (as in the case of the CelebA dataset), to four, as would be needed to represent the four seasons. Even using the CelebA dataset with just four attributes saw convergence and training issues arise.

A clear next step for this work to function would be to implement a new loss function better suited to this type of generation. This network currently uses **Binary Cross-Entropy** as the loss function, and as described in (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347524660_Geometric_Morphometric_Data_Augmentation_Using_Generative_Computational_Learning_Algorithms), Wasserstein Loss implemented in GANs generally improves stability and performance of the network, including preventing the issue of mode collapse. An attempted train of thee model using SEN12MS ended up producing unpromising results, with outputs like the following, clearly indicating the possibility of mode collapse:
